## 1.9.0

### Important announcements

**New Networking Concepts and API's: Fabrics, Spaces and Subnets**
    With the introduction of new MAAS networking concepts, new API's are also
    been introduced. These are:

    > -   fabrics
    > -   spaces
    > -   subnets
    > -   vlans
    > -   fan-networks

    MAAS 1.9.0 will continue to provide backwards compatibility with the old
    network API for reading purposes, but moving forward, users are required
    to use the new API to manipulate fabrics, spaces and subnets.

**Advanced Network and Storage Configuration only available for Ubuntu deployments**
    Users can now perform advanced network and storage configurations for
    nodes before deployment. The advanced configuration is only available for
    Ubuntu deployments. All other deployments using third party OS', including
    CentOS, RHEL, Windows and Custom Images, won't result in such
    configuration.

**Re-commissioning required for upgraded MAAS**
    Now that storage partitioning and advanced configuration is supported
    natively, VM nodes in MAAS need to be re-commissioned.

    > -   If upgrading from MAAS 1.8, only VM nodes with VirtIO storage
    >     devices need to be re-commissioned.
    > -   If upgrading from MAAS 1.7, all nodes will need to be
    >     re-commissioned in order for MAAS to correctly capture the storage
    >     and networking devices.

    This does not affect nodes that are currently deployed.

**Default Storage Partitioning Layout - Flat**
    With the introduction of custom storage, MAAS has also introduced the
    concept of partitioning layouts. Partitioning layouts allow the user to
    quickly auto-configure the disk partitioning scheme after first
    commissioning or re-commissioning (if selected to do so). The partitioning
    layouts are set globally on the Settings page.

    The current default Partitioning layout is 'Flat', maintaining backwards
    compatibility with previous MAAS releases. This means MAAS will take the
    first disk it finds in the system and use it as the root and boot disk.

**Deployment with configured /etc/network/interfaces**
    Starting with MAAS 1.9, all node deployments will result in writing
    /etc/network/interfaces statically, by default. This increases MAAS'
    robustness and reliability as users no longer have to depend on DHCP for
    IP address allocation solely.

    MAAS will continue to provide IP addresses via DHCP, even though
    interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces may have been configured statically.

### Major new features

**Storage Partitioning and Advanced Configuration**
    MAAS now supports Storage Partitioning and Advanced Configuration
    natively. This allows MAAS to deploy machines with different Storage
    Layouts, as well as different complex partitioning configurations. Storage
    support includes:

    -   LVM
    -   Bcache
    -   Software RAID levels 0, 1, 5, 6, 10.
    -   Advanced partitioning

    Storace configuration is available both via the WebUI and API. For more
    information refer to storage.

**Advanced Networking (Fabrics, Spaces, Subnetworks) and Node Network Configuration**
    MAAS now supports Advanced Network configuration, allowing users to not
    only perform advanced node network configuration, but also allowing users
    to declare and map their infrastructure in the form of Fabrics, VLANs,
    Spaces and Subnets.

    **Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and Fan networks**
        MAAS now supports the concept of Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and FANS,
        which introduce a whole new way of declaring and mapping your network
        and infrastructure in MAAS.

        The MAAS WebUI allows users to view all the declared Fabrics, Spaces,
        VLANs inside fabrics and Subnets inside Spaces. The WebUI does not yet
        support the ability to create new of these, but the API does.

        These new concepts replace the old Network concepts from MAAS' earlier
        versions. For more information, see networking.

        For more information about the API, see api.

    **Advanced Node Networking Configuration**
        MAAS can now perform the Node's networking configuration. Doing so,
        results in /etc/network/interfaces being written. Advanced
        configuration includes:

        > -   Assign subnets, fabrics, and IP to interfaces.
        > -   Create VLAN interfaces.
        > -   Create bond interfaces.
        > -   Change interface names.

        MAAS also allows configuration of node interfaces in different modes:

        > -   Auto Assign - Node interface will be configured statically and
        >     MAAS will auto assign an IP address.
        > -   DHCP - The node interface will be configured to DHCP.
        > -   Static - The user will be able to specify what IP address the
        >     interface will obtain, while MAAS will configure it statically.
        > -   Unconfigured - MAAS will leave the interface with LINK UP.

**Curtin & cloud-init status updates**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0, curtin and cloud-init will now send messages to
    MAAS providing information regarding various of the actions being taken.
    This information will be displayed in MAAS in the Node Event Log.

    Note that this information is only available when using MAAS 1.9.0 and the
    latest version fo curtin. For cloud-init messages this information is only
    available when deploying Wily+.

**Fabric and subnet creation**
    MAAS now auto-creates multiple fabrics per physical interface connected to
    the Cluster Controller, and will correctly create subnetworks under each
    fabric, as well as VLAN's, if any of the Cluster Controller interface is a
    VLAN interface.

**HWE Kernels**
    MAAS now has a different approach to deploying Hardware Enablement
    Kernels. Start from MAAS 1.9, the HWE kernels are no longer coupled to
    subarchitectures of a machine. For each Ubuntu release, users will be able
    to select any of the available HWE kernels for such release, as well as
    set the minimum kernel the machine will be deployed with by default.

    For more information, see hardware-enablement-kernels.

**CentOS images can be imported automatically**
    CentOS Image (CentOS 6 and 7) can now be imported automatically from the
    MAAS Images page. These images are currently part of the daily streams.

    In order to test this images, you need to use the daily image stream. This
    can be changed in the Settings page under Boot Images to
    http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/. Once changed, images
    can be imported from the MAAS Images page. The CentOS image will be
    published in the Releases stream shortly.

### Minor notable changes

**Minimal Config Files for Daemons**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, minimal configuration files have been introduced
    for both, the MAAS Region Controller and the MAAS Cluster Controller
    daemons.

    -   The Region Controller (maas-regiond) has now dropped the usage of
        /etc/maas/maas\_local\_settings.py in favor of /etc/maas/regiond.conf.
        Available configuration options are now database\_host,
        database\_name, database\_user, database\_pass, maas\_url. MAAS will
        attempt to migrate any configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use
        sane defaults.
    -   The Cluster Controller (maas-clusterd) has now dropped the usage of
        /etc/maas/pserv.yaml and /etc/maas/maas\_cluster.conf in favor of
        /etc/maas/clusterd.conf. Available configuration options are now
        maas\_url and cluster\_uuid only. MAAS will attempt to migrate any
        configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use sane defaults.

**Commissioning Actions**
    MAAS now supports commissioning actions. These allow the user to specify
    how commissioning should behave in certain escenarios. The commissioning
    actions available are:

    > -   Enable SSH during commissioning & Keep machine ON after
    >     commissioning
    > -   Keep network configuration after commissioning
    > -   Keep storage configuration after commissioning

**Warn users about missing power control tools**
    MAAS now warns users about the missing power control tools. Each MAAS
    power driver use a set of power tools that may or may not be installed by
    default. If these power tools are missing from the system, MAAS will warn
    users.

**Python Power Drivers**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, MAAS is moving away from using shell scripts
    templates for Power Drivers. These are being migrated to MAAS' internal
    control as power drivers. Currently supported are APC, MSCM, MSFT OCS,
    SM15k, UCSM, Virsh, VMWare and IPMI.

    Remaining Power Drivers include AMT, Fence CDU's, Moonshot.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**Garbage in the UI after upgrade**
    When upgrading from any earlier release (1.5, 1.7, 1.8), the user may see
    garbage in the UI. This is because the local cache is dirty and won't be
    refreshed automatically. MAAS 1.9.0 introduced a mechanism to refresh the
    cache automatically, but this will only take into effect upgrading from
    1.9.0 to any later release.

    To work around this issue, the only thing required is to refresh the
    browsers cache, by hitting F5.

    See bug [1515380](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1515380) for more
    information.

## 1.9.0 (beta1)

### Major New Features

**Storage Configuration: LVM and RAID UI**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (beta1), MAAS now exposes custom storage
    configuration in the WebUI for the following:

    > -   LVM: Ability to easily create LVM.
    > -   RAID: Ability to create RAID 0, 1, 5, 6.

### Minor notable changes

**Fabric and subnet creation**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (beta1), MAAS now auto-creates multiple fabrics
    per physical interface connected to the Cluster Controller, and will
    correctly create subnetworks under each fabric, as well as VLAN's if any
    VLAN interface on the Cluster Controller is preset.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout**
    CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided
    that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail,
    unless this layout is changed to 'Flat' storage.

    To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from
    LVM to Flat in MAAS' Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

    See bug [1499558](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1499558) for more
    information.

**Fail to deploy (boot) with UEFI**
    MAAS will successfully instal in a UEFI system, however, after deployment
    it won't boot onto the local disk. See bug
    [1510120](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1510120) for more information.

## 1.9.0 (alpha5)

### Major New Features

**Storage Configuration: Partitioning and Bcache UI**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha5), MAAS now exposes storage custom storage
    configuration in the WebUI for the following:

    > -   Partitioning: Ability to create and delete partitions.
    > -   Bcache: Ability to create cache sets and bcache devices, allowing
    >     multiple bcache devices to use the same cache set.

### Minor notable changes

**Warn users about missing power control tools**
    MAAS now warns users about the missing power control tools. Each MAAS
    power driver use a set of power tools that may or may not be installed by
    default. If these power tools are missing from the system, MAAS will warn
    users.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout**
    CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided
    that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail,
    unless this layout is changed to 'Flat' storage.

    information.

**Juju 1.24.6 bootstrap failure - Changing MAAS configured /etc/network/interfaces**
    Juju 1.24.6 (or less), assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed node's
    network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and disables
    bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC. However,
    provided that MAAS / curtin now writes the node's network configuration,
    Juju is unable to successfully finish the creation of the bridge, but in
    the process, it disables auto bring up of eth0.

    Starting from Juju 1.24.7+, Juju has grown support to correctly manage a
    /etc/network/interfaces that has been created after deployment with MAAS
    1.9.0.

    See bug [1494476](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1494476) for more
    information.

## 1.9.0 (alpha4)

### Minor notable changes

> -   Various UI cosmetic fixes and improvements.
> -   Do not create MBR larger than 2TiB for LVM.
> -   Various concurrency fixes and improvements to robustness.

    Juju 1.24+, by default, assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed
    node's network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and
    disables bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC.
    However, provided that MAAS / curtin now write the node's network
    configuration, Juju is unable to successfully finish the creation of the
    bridge, but in the process, it disables auto bring up of eth0.

    The machine will deploy successfully, however, after a reboot eth0 will
    never be brought back up due to the changes made by Juju. This will
    prevent Juju from SSH'ing into the machine and finishing the boostrap.

    To prevent this from happening, disable-network-management: true needs to
    be used. Note that this will prevent the deployment of LXC containers as
    they have to DHCP.

    information.

## 1.9.0 (alpha3)

### Major New Features

**Advanced Node Network Configuration UI**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha3), MAAS can now do the Node's Network
    configuration. Doing such configuration will result in having
    /etc/network/interfaces writen.

    Advanced configuration UI includes:

    > -   Create VLAN interfaces.
    > -   Create bond interfaces.
    > -   Create Alias interfaces.
    > -   Change interface names.

**Subnetworks page UI**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha3), MAAS can now show the new Subnets tab
    in the UI. This allow users to view:

    > -   Fabrics
    > -   Spaces
    > -   VLANs in fabrics.
    > -   Subnets in Spaces.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout**
    CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided
    that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail,
    unless this layout is changed to 'Flat' storage.

    To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from
    LVM to Flat in MAAS' Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

    See bug [1499558](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1499558) for more
    information.

## 1.9.0 (alpha2)

### Important announcements

**Installation by default configures /etc/network/interfaces**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), all Ubuntu deployments will result with
    static network configurations. Users will be able to interact with the API
    to further configure interfaces.

**Introduction to Fabrics, Spaces and Subnets introduces new Network API**
    With the introduction of the concepts of Fabrics, Spaces and Subnets
    starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS also introduces new API's for:

    > -   fabrics
    > -   spaces
    > -   subnets
    > -   vlans
    > -   fan-networks

    MAAS 1.9.0 will continue to provide backwards compatibility with the old
    network API for reading purposes, but moving forward, users are required
    to use the new API to manipulate fabrics, spaces and subnets.

### Major New Features

**Advanced Node Network Configuration**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS can now do the Node's Network
    configuration. Doing such configuration will result in having
    /etc/network/interfaces writen.

    Advanced configuration includes:

    > -   Assign subnets, fabrics, and IP to interfaces.
    > -   Create VLAN interfaces.
    > -   Create bond interfaces.
    > -   Change interface names.

**Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and Fan networks**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS now supports the concept of
    Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and FANS.

    These new concepts replaces the old Network concepts from MAAS' earlier
    versions. For more information, see networking.

    For more information about the API, see api.

**Curtin & cloud-init status updates**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), curtin and cloud-init will now send
    messages to MAAS providing information regarding various of the actions
    taken. This information will be displayed in MAAS in the Node Event Log.

    Note that this information is only available when using MAAS 1.9.0 and the
    latest version fo curtin. For cloud-init messages this information is only
    available when deploying Wily.

### Minor notable changes

**Commissioning Actions**
    MAAS now supports commissioning actions. These allow the user to specify
    how commissioning should behave in certain escenarios. The commissioning
    actions available are:

    > -   Enable SSH during commissioning
    > -   Keep machine ON after commissioning
    > -   Keep network configuration after commissioning
    > -   Keep storage configuration after commissioning

**CentOS images can be imported automatically**
    CentOS Image (CentOS 6 and 7) can now be imported automatically from the
    MAAS Images page. These images are currently part of the daily streams.

    In order to test this images, you need to use the daily image stream. This
    can be changed in the Settings page under Boot Images to
    http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/. Once changed, images
    can be imported from the MAAS Images page.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

## 1.9.0 (alpha1)

### Important announcements

**LVM is now the default partitioning layout**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, all of the deployments will result on having LVM
    configure for each of the machines. A Flat partitioning layout is not
    longer used by default. (This, however, can be changed in the MAAS
    Settings Page).

**Re-commissioning required from VM's with VirtIO devices**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, storage partitioning and advance configuration is
    supported natively (see below). In order for MAAS to correctly map VirtIO
    devices in VM's, these VM nodes need to be re-commissioned.

    If not re-comissioned, MAAS will prevent the deployment until done so.
    Previously deployed nodes won't be affected, but will also have to be
    re-commissioned if released.

### Major new features

**Storage Partitioning and Advanced Configuration**
    MAAS now natively supports Storage Partitioning and Advanced
    Configuration. This allows MAAS to deploy machines with different Storage
    Layouts, as well as different complext partitioning configurations.
    Storage support includes:

    -   LVM
    -   Bcache
    -   Software Raid
    -   Advanced partitioning

    For more information refer to storage.

### Minor notable changes

**Minimal Config Files for Daemons**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, minimal configuration files have been introduced
    for both, the MAAS Region Controller and the MAAS Cluster Controller
    daemons.

    -   The Region Controller (maas-regiond) has now dropped the usage of
        /etc/maas/maas\_local\_settings.py in favor of /etc/maas/regiond.conf.
        Available configuration options are now database\_host,
        database\_name, database\_user, database\_pass, maas\_url. MAAS will
        attempt to migrate any configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use
        sane defaults.
    -   The Cluster Controller (maas-clusterd) has now dropped the usage of
        /etc/maas/pserv.yaml and /etc/maas/maas\_cluster.conf in favor of
        /etc/maas/clusterd.conf. Available configuration options are now
        maas\_url and cluster\_uuid only. MAAS will attempt to migrate any
        configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use sane defaults.

**HWE Kernels**
    MAAS now has a different approach to deploying Hardware Enablement
    Kernels. Start from MAAS 1.9, the HWE kernels are no longer coupled to
    subarchitectures of a machine. For each Ubuntu release, users will be able
    to select any of the available HWE kernels for such release, as well as
    set the minimum kernel the machine will be deployed with by default.

    For more information, see hardware-enablement-kernels.

**Python Power Drivers**
    Starting from MAAS 1.9, MAAS is moving away from using shell scripts
    templates for Power Drivers. These are being migrated to MAAS' internal
    control as power drivers. Currently supported are APC, MSCM, MSFT OCS,
    SM15k, UCSM, Virsh, VMWare and IPMI.

    Remaining Power Drivers include AMT, Fence CDU's, Moonshot.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**Fail to deploy Trusty due to missing bcache-tools**
    In order to correctly perform storage partitioning in Trusty+, the new
    version of curtin used by MAAS requires bcache-tools to be installed.
    However, these tools are not available in Trusty, hence causing
    MAAS/curtin deployment failures when installing Trusty. An SRU in Ubuntu
    Trusty for these tools is already in progress.

    To work around the problem, a curtin custom configuration to install
    bcache-tools can be used in \`/etc/maas/preseeds/curtin\_userdata\`:

        {{if node.get_distro_series() in ['trusty']}}
        early_commands:
          add_repo: ["add-apt-repository", "-y", "ppa:maas-maintainers/experimental"]
        {{endif}}

    See bug [1449099](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1449099) for more
    information.

**Fail to deploy LVM in Trusty**
    MAAS fail to deploy Ubuntu Trusty with a LVM Storage layout, as curtin
    will fail to perform the partitioning. See bug
    [1488632](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1488632) for more information.
