# Storage

MAAS doesn't just do simple partitioning it supports complex storage layouts,
including setting up and configuring Bcache, RAID, and LVM. This gives users
unlimited possibilities on the storage configurations they want to deploy.

## Layouts

When a node is acquired by a user it gets a default storage layout. This
layout provides the basic storage configuration to allow a node to deploy
successfully. The default storage layout can also be adjusted allowing an
administrator to make the decision on which layout will be the default.

The users deploying nodes are not limited by the default. They can set an
explicit storage layout when they acquire a node or after they have acquried a
node with the set-storage-layout API. The user acquiring a node or performing
the set-storage-layout API calls can also customize the layout generation.
Each layout has a set of options that can be set to adjust the generated
layout.

Below list all the available storage layouts and the available options for
each.

### LVM Layout

Creates a volume group vgroot on a partition that spans the entire boot disk.
A logical volume lvroot is created for the full size of the volume group. The
lvroot is formatted with ext4 and set as the / mount point:

```no-highlight
    NAME        SIZE        TYPE    FSTYPE         MOUNTPOINT
    sda         100G        disk
      sda1      512M        part    fat32          /boot/efi
      sda2      99.5G       part    lvm-pv(vgroot)
    vgroot      99.5G       lvm
      lvroot    99.5G       lvm     ext4           /
```

The following options are supported for this layout. :

- **boot_size**: Size of the boot partition on the boot disk. Default is 0, meaning
  not to create the boot partition. The '/boot' will be placed on the root
  filesystem.
- **root_device**: The block device to place the root partition on. Default is the
  boot disk.
- **root_size**: Size of the root partition. Default is 100%, meaning the entire
  size of the root device.
- **vg_name**: Name of the created volume group. Default is `vgroot`.  lv_name:
  Name of the created logical volume. Default is `lvroot`.  lv_size: Size of
  the created logical volume. Default is 100%, meaning the entire size of the
  volume group.

### Flat Layout

Creates a partition that spans the entire boot disk. The partition is
formatted with ext4 and set as the / mount point. :

```no-highlight
    NAME        SIZE        TYPE    FSTYPE         MOUNTPOINT
    sda         100G        disk
      sda1      512M        part    fat32          /boot/efi
      sda2      99.5G       part    ext4           /
```

The following options are supported for this layout. :


- **boot_size**: Size of the boot partition on the boot disk. Default is 0,
  meaning not to create the boot partition. The '/boot' will be placed on the
  root filesystem.
- **root_device**: The block device to place the root partition on. Default is
  the boot disk.
- **root_size**: Size of the root partition. Default is 100%, meaning the
  entire size of the root device.

### Bcache Layout

Creates a Bcache using a partition that spans the entire boot disk as the
backing device. Uses the smallest block device tagged with ssd as the cache
device. The Bcache device is formatted with ext4 and set as the / mount point.
If no block devices exists on the node that are tagged with ssd then the Bcache
device will not be created and the flat layout will be used. :

```no-highlight
    NAME        SIZE        TYPE    FSTYPE         MOUNTPOINT
    sda         100G        disk
      sda1      512M        part    fat32          /boot/efi
      sda2      99.5G       part    bc-backing
    sdb         50G         disk
      sdb1      50G         part    bc-cache
    bcache0     99.5G       disk    ext4           /
```

The following options are supported for this layout. :

- **boot_size**: Size of the boot partition on the boot disk. Default is 0,
  meaning not to create the boot partition. The '/boot' will be placed on the
root filesystem.
- **root_device**: The block device to place the root partition on. Default is
  the boot disk.
- **root_size**: Size of the root partition. Default is 100%, meaning the
  entire size of the root device.
- **cache_device**: The block device to use as the cache device. Default is the
  smallest block device tagged ssd.
- **cache_mode**:: The cache mode to set the created Bcache device to. Default
  is `writethrough`.
- **cache_size**: The size of the partition on the cache device. Default is
  100%, meaning the entire size of the cache device.
- **cache_no_part**: Whether or not to create a partition on the cache device.
  Default is false, meaning to create a partition using the given `cache_size`.
  If set to true no partition will be created and the raw cache device will be
  used as the cache.

!!! Note: 
    The /boot/efi partition on all layouts will only be created on nodes that
    deploy with UEFI.

## Setting the Layout

### Globally

The global default storage layout can be set using the API and the UI. This
will change the default storage layout for when a node is acquired. \`It will
not adjust the layout of any node that is already passed the acquire stage:

```bash
maas my-maas-session maas set_config name=default_storage_layout value=flat
```
### Set Storage Layout

If a node is already acquired and you want to adjust the storage layout the
`set_storage_layout` API call can be used. The options for this API call do not
require the `storage_layout()` prefix:

```bash
maas my-maas-session node set-storage-layout <system-id> storage_layout=lvm lv_size=50%
```
!!! Note:
    This will completely remove any previous storage configuration on all block
    devices.

## Block Devices

Once the initial storage layout has been configure on a node you can perform
many operations to view and adjust the entire storage layout for the node. In
MAAS there are two different types of block devices.

**Physical**

A physical block device is a physically attached block device. This being true
storage on a machine. E.g. A 100G hard drive in a server.

**Virtual**

A virtual block device is a block device that is exposed by the Linux kernel
when an operation is performed. Almost all the operations on a physical block
device can be performed on a virtual block device. E.g. A RAID device exposed
as md0.

### List Block Devices

To view all block devices on a node use the *read* operation. This list both
physical and virtual block devices.:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-devices read node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```yaml
    [
        {
            "size": 21474836480,
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/",

                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
            "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
            "tags": [],
            "partitions": [],
            "name": "vgroot-lvroot",
            "partition_table_type": null,
            "filesystem": {
                "label": "root",
                "mount_point": "/",
                "uuid": "9f09e3fd-2484-4da5-bb56-a72a0c478d06",
                "fstype": "ext4"
            },
            "id_path": null,
            "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/lvroot",
            "model": null,
            "block_size": 4096,
            "type": "virtual",
            "id": 11,
            "serial": null,
            "size": 21470642176
        }
    ]
```

### Read Block Device

If you want to read just one block device instead of listing all block devices
the *read* operation on the block-device endpoint provides that information:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device read node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 12
```

This produces the following output:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21474836480,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/12/",
        "uuid": null,
        "tags": [],
        "name": "sdb",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "id_path": "",
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sdb",
        "model": "QEMU HARDDISK",
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "physical",
        "id": 12,
        "serial": "QM00001",
        "partitions": []
    }
```

It is also possible to use the name of the block device instead of its ID:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device read node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f sdb
```

Which will create output similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21474836480,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/12/",
        "uuid": null,
        "tags": [],
        "name": "sdb",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "id_path": "",
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sdb",
        "model": "QEMU HARDDISK",
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "physical",
        "id": 12,
        "serial": "QM00001",
        "partitions": []
    }
```

!!! Note: 
    MAAS allows the name of a block device to be changed. If the block device name
    has changed then the API call needs to use the new name. Using the ID is safer
    as it never changes.

### Create Block Device

This operation only allows an administrator to add a physical block device to a
node. It is not recommended to create a block device as you need very specific
information for each block device. It is recommended to re-commissioning the
machine for MAAS to gather the required information. If MAAS does not provide
the required information this API exists only as a fallback:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-devices create node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f name=sdb model="QEMU HARDDISK" serial="QM00001" size=21474836480 block_size=4096
```

This will generate the following output:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21474836480,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/12/",
        "uuid": null,
        "tags": [],
        "name": "sdb",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "id_path": "",
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sdb",
        "model": "QEMU HARDDISK",
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "physical",
        "id": 12,
        "serial": "QM00001",
        "partitions": []
    }
```

!!! Note: 
    The serial number is what MAAS will use when a node is deployed to find the
    specific block device. Its very important that this be absolutely correct. In
    a rare chance that your block device does not provide a model or serial number
    you can provide an id_path. The id_path should be a path that is always the
    same, no matter the kernel version.

### Update Block Device

Provides the ability for an administrator needs to update the information of a
physical block device and a standard user to update information of a virtual
block device. A standard user cannot update the information of a physical block
device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device update node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 11 name=newroot
```

Generating the following output:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21470642176,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
        "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
        "tags": [],
        "name": "vgroot-newroot",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": "root",
            "mount_point": "/",
            "uuid": "9f09e3fd-2484-4da5-bb56-a72a0c478d06",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/vgroot-newroot",
        "model": null,
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "virtual",
        "id": 11,
        "serial": null,
        "partitions": []
    }
```

### Delete Block Device

Allows an adminstrator to delete a physical block device and a standard user
to delete a virtual block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device delete node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 12
```
### Format Block Device

Format the entire block device with a file system:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device format node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 11 fstype=ext4
```

Generating the following output:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21470642176,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
        "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
        "tags": [],
        "name": "vgroot-newroot",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": null,
            "mount_point": null,
            "uuid": "b713af05-3f1c-4ddc-b4dd-a7878e6af14f",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/vgroot-newroot",
        "model": null,
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "virtual",
        "id": 11,
        "serial": null,
        "partitions": []
    }
```
!!! Note: 
    You cannot format a block device that contains partitions or is used to make
    another virtual block device.

### Unformat Block Device

Remove the file system from the block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device unformat node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 11
```

Producing output similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21470642176,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
        "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
        "tags": [],
        "name": "vgroot-newroot",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/vgroot-newroot",
        "model": null,
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "virtual",
        "id": 11,
        "serial": null,
        "partitions": []
    }
```

### Mount Block Device

Mount the block device at the given mount point. Block device is required to
have a filesystem:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device mount node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 11 mount_point=/srv
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21470642176,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
        "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
        "tags": [],
        "name": "vgroot-newroot",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": null,
            "mount_point": "/srv",
            "uuid": "b892e5c3-8bea-4371-a456-bde11df3df40",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/vgroot-newroot",
        "model": null,
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "virtual",
        "id": 11,
        "serial": null,
        "partitions": []
    }
```

### Unmount Block Device

Remove the mount point from the block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device unmount node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 11
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "size": 21470642176,
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/11/",
        "uuid": "f58b8fb2-dcf2-4ba9-a01c-60409829a64e",
        "tags": [],
        "name": "vgroot-newroot",
        "partition_table_type": null,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": null,
            "mount_point": null,
            "uuid": "b892e5c3-8bea-4371-a456-bde11df3df40",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/vgroot-newroot",
        "model": null,
        "block_size": 4096,
        "type": "virtual",
        "id": 11,
        "serial": null,
        "partitions": []
    }
```

### Set as Boot Disk

MAAS by default picks the first added block device to the node as the boot
disk. In most cases this works as expected as the BIOS enumerates the boot disk
as the first block device. There are cases where this fails and the boot disk
needs to be set to another disk. This API allow setting which block device on a
node MAAS should use as the boot disk.:

```bash
maas my-maas-session block-device set-boot-disk node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6
```
Successful configuration will output `OK`.

!!! Note:
    Only an administrator can set which block device should be used as the boot
    disk and only a physical block device can be set as a the boot disk. This
    operation should be done before a node is acquired or the storage layout will
    be applied to the previous boot disk.

## Partitions

### List Partitions

View all the partitions on a block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session partitions read node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    [
        {
            "uuid": "e94ca09a-d83e-4521-8bac-833da2ed0b3e",
            "bootable": false,
            "filesystem": {
                "label": null,
                "mount_point": null,
                "uuid": "61d447c2-387d-4fb1-885a-65eeef91e92a",
                "fstype": "lvm-pv"
            },
            "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
            "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/1",
            "type": "partition",
            "id": 1,
            "size": 21471690752
        }
    ]
```

### Read Partition

If you want to read just one partition on a block device instead of listing
all partitions read operation on the partition endpoint provides that
information:

```bash
maas my-maas-session partition read node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 1
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "uuid": "e94ca09a-d83e-4521-8bac-833da2ed0b3e",
        "bootable": false,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": null,
            "mount_point": null,
            "uuid": "61d447c2-387d-4fb1-885a-65eeef91e92a",
            "fstype": "lvm-pv"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/1",
        "type": "partition",
        "id": 1,
        "size": 21471690752
    }
```
### Create Partition

To create a partition on a block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session partitions create node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 size=2G
```

Output will look similar to the following:

        "bootable": false,
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/2",
        "type": "partition",
        "id": 2,
        "size": 2000003072
    }
```
### Delete Partition

To delete a partition from a block device:

```bash
maas my-maas-session partition delete node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 2
```

### Format Partition

To format the partition with a file system:

```bash
maas my-maas-session partition format node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 3 fstype=ext4
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "uuid": "fb468be6-64bd-434a-b95b-b8c932610960",
        "bootable": false,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": "",
            "mount_point": null,
            "uuid": "8fbb4e35-cb65-49f7-8377-f00f48ac9da9",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/3",

```bash
maas my-maas-session partition unformat node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 3
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "uuid": "fb468be6-64bd-434a-b95b-b8c932610960",
        "bootable": false,
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/3",
        "type": "partition",
        "id": 3,
        "size": 2000003072
    }
```
### Mount Partition

o mount the partition at the given mount point (partition is required to have a
filesystem):

```bash
maas my-maas-session partition mount node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f 6 3 mount_point=/srv
```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "uuid": "fb468be6-64bd-434a-b95b-b8c932610960",
        "bootable": false,
        "filesystem": {

            "mount_point": "/srv",
            "uuid": "b59ad2c3-cffa-4cda-830f-276df4151c1c",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/3",
        "type": "partition",
        "id": 3,
        "size": 2000003072
    }
```

### Unmount Partition

Remove the mount point from the partition:

```bash

```

Output will look similar to the following:

```yaml
    {
        "uuid": "fb468be6-64bd-434a-b95b-b8c932610960",
        "bootable": false,
        "filesystem": {
            "label": "",
            "mount_point": null,
            "uuid": "b59ad2c3-cffa-4cda-830f-276df4151c1c",
            "fstype": "ext4"
        },
        "path": "/dev/disk/by-dname/sda-part1",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-f4e2281c-d19a-11e4-a5ac-00163edde41f/blockdevices/6/partition/3",
        "type": "partition",
        "id": 3,
        "size": 2000003072
    }
```
## Restrictions

There are only a couple of restrictions that exists in the storage
configuration. These restrictions are only in place because they are known to
not allow a successful deployment:

- EFI partition is required to be on the boot disk for UEFI.
- Cannot place partitions on logical volumes.
- Cannot use a logical volume as a Bcache backing device.
