# Import images

By default, the most recent LTS release (and amd64 architecture) are selected.
To change the selections go to the Images tab, select any other images (by
choosing 'Release' and 'Architecture'), and click the 'Import images' button.

A message will appear to indicate that the import process has started. 
Depending on available bandwidth, any warnings about the lack of images
will eventually disappear once the download has finished.

See [Local Mirroring of Boot Images](./sstreams-mirror.html) for information on
how to set up a mirror and configure MAAS to use it.
