# Installation

There are three ways to install MAAS:

- [From an Ubuntu Server ISO](installconfig-server-iso.html). Install and
  configure a region controller or a rack controller during the ISO
  installation of Ubuntu Server.

- [From packages](installconfig-package-install.html). Install packages for
  individual MAAS components.

- [Locally with LXD](installconfig-lxd-install.html). Create a self-contained
  MAAS environment with LXD containers.
