# Installation

There are three main ways to install MAAS:

- [From Ubuntu Server](installconfig-server-iso.html). Easily configure a
  server as either a region controller or a rack controller from a new Ubuntu
  Server installation. 

- [From a package repository](installconfig-package-install.html). Add MAAS
  packages for region and rack controllers to a system already running Ubuntu. 

- [Locally with LXD](installconfig-lxd-install.html). Create a local MAAS
  environment within a container that is capable of running the region
  controller, the rack controller and multiple nodes.
