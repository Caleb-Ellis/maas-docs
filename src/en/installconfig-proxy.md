# Proxy Configuration

In most cases, the machines deployed in a MAAS installation will use a proxy
to access the archive. Alternatively, MAAS can be told to use an externall
configured proxy, or none at all.

As of MAAS 2.0, the default MAAS region controller configuration will create a
maas-proxy configuration that explicitly allows all of the subnets in the
configuration to use it for a proxy.

## Assumptions

It is generally assumed that the MAAS region controller is not exposed to
untusted networks. (That is, that there is a firewall between the MAAS region
controller and any such networks.) Prior to MAAS 2.0, the only option if this
was not the case was to manually edit /etc/maas/maas-proxy.conf, or use
iptables to create a firewall on the host.

As of MAAS 2.0, permission to use the proxy can be managed on a per-subnet
basis. (The default is to allow proxying.)

## MAAS Proxy Installation

When you install a Region Controller, maas-proxy will be installed. The
configuration of the proxy relies on maas-proxy being on the same machine as
the Region Controller.

## Using an external proxy

If you want to use an external proxy, see the Network Configuration section of
the web user interface to set the proxy url.

Alternatively, the following command will specify squid.example.com as the
proxy, using port 3128:

    $ maas admin maas set-config name=http_proxy value=http://squid.example.com:3128/

## Disable proxying for a Subnet

As an example, we will configure MAAS to disable the proxy for a subnet:

    $ maas admin subnet update 192.168.0.0/22 allow_proxy=False

## Enable proxying for a Subnet

To re-enable the proxy for that subnet:

    $ maas admin subnet update 192.168.0.0/22 allow_proxy=True

## Allow an arbitrary subnet to use the Proxy

Since the default is to allow proxying, simply create the subnet in MAAS:

    $ maas admin subnets create cidr=192.168.100.0/23

You may wish to set other parameters on the subnet.

## Disabling proxying

If you want to not use any proxy, see the Network Configuration section of the
web user interface and uncheck the "Enable the use of an APT and HTTP/HTTPS
proxy" box.

Alternatively, the following command will disable the proxy:

    $ maas admin maas set-config name=enable_http_proxy value=False
