Title: MAAS | Management Summary

# Management summary

MAAS can be managed, typically by a systems administrator, in the following
ways:

- GUI (web interface)
- CLI (text-based terminal)
- API (involves programming)

This section will cover each briefly. Details of each will be provided in
future chapters.


## GUI

The web-based GUI is how most people will interact with MAAS. It gets installed along
with the MAAS software. See
[Accessing the GUI](./installconfig-gui-access.html).


## CLI

The CLI consists of the `maas` wrapper command that interacts with the API. See
[maas command](http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/man/maas.8.html).

To get a sense of what is possible with the CLI see [MAAS CLI](./managing-cli.html).


## API

The API is typically reserved for large-scale automization. See
[API / CLI Documentation](http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/index.html#api-cli-documentation).
